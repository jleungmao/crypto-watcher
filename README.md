# crypto-watcher

A simple full stack application that scrapes live Bitcoin and Ethereum prices from Blockchain.com and Bittrex.com to recommend which site to buy/sell each currency on.  

This application uses Express, Puppeteer and Cheerio for the backend and React, MaterialUI, and Axios for the frontend.

# build-and-run

Download the project and run the **backend first**. To get the server running, open the project to the backend folder with your code editor. Make sure you are in the **backend directory**, and run the following commands in the terminal:

1. npm install
2. npm run start

Then to load the **frontend of the application**, open a new code editor to the frontend directory. From this directory, run the following commands in the terminal:

1. npm install
2. npm run build
3. npm run start
